# If
*Syntax:* 
```
if{ (then-block) }{ (else-block) }
```

The **If** statement allows you to execute conditional blocks of code. It checks (and drops) the top element of the stack.

If that element is **true**, the **then-block** is executed.

If that element is **false**, the **else-block** is executed.

<br>

# For
*Syntax:* 
```
for{ (body-block) }
```

The **For** statement allows you to execute the same block of code multiple times. It drops the top element of the stack and executes the **body-block** that number of times.
